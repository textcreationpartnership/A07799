      * Notwithſtanding that the word Rocke ſhall point at S. Peter (according vnto the expoſition of ſome Fathers,) yet doth not this ſo fully aduantage the Romiſh claime: euen by the iudgement of our learned Aduerſaries.

      * That this chiefly pretended foundation of Popedome is ruinous, by the generall expoſitions of ancient Fathers, who teach that by, Rocke, in Matth. 16. Chriſt is ſignified, and not Peter.
